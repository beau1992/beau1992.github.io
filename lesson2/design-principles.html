        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>

        <p>Visual hierarchy refers to the arrangement or presentation 
            of elements in a way that implies importance. In other 
            words, visual hierarchy influences the order in which 
            the human eye perceives what it sees. This order is 
            created by the visual contrast between forms in a 
            field of perception.</p>
            <p>KSL's website uses the concept of hierarchy 
                by putting the things they feel are most 
                important at the top and making the most important
                things the biggest and then smaller as they want to 
                demonstrate less attention as you scroll down the page.

        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>
            </p>
        
            <img class="column-image" src="/images/wikipedia.JPG" 
            alt="A screenshot of Wikipedia's homepage">
        <p>Alignment refers to placing text and other design 
            elements on a page so they line up. It helps to 
            create order, organize your elements, create visual
             connections, and improve the readability of your 
             design.</p>
             <p>Wikipedia is pretty much all about information on almost
                 anything. You don't even have to be able to see the content
                 to be able to see that Wikipedia is very good at alignment. 
                 Everything lines up and has its place in line to help
                 keep everything organized.

        <h2>White Space</h2>
        <p>
                <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/">tripadvisor</a>
        </p>
        <img class="column-image" src="/images/tripadvisor.JPG" 
            alt="A screenshot of tripadvisor">
<p>In page layout, illustration and sculpture, white space 
    is often referred to as negative space. It is the 
    portion of a page left unmarked: margins, gutters, 
    and space between columns, lines of type, graphics, 
    figures, or objects drawn or depicted.</p>
    <p>tripadvisor makes good use of whitespace by having
        a white background and colorful images and icons
        to navigate the website.
